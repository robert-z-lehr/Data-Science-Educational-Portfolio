- Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Functions

Given a [raw dataset](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Unveiling_Crowdfunding_Trends/Excel/CrowdfundingBook_raw.xlsx) of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects from platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, this project uses Excel to produce a [dataset](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Unveiling_Crowdfunding_Trends/Excel/CrowdfundingBook.xlsx) which manipulates and analyze the raw data to uncover hidden trends and key market insights.

The data manipulation and analysis includes:
- conditional formatting, (to visually distinguish campaign outcomes – successful, failed, canceled, or live)
- using formulas to populate new columns
- Pivot tables and stacked-column pivot charts are constructed to assess campaign outcomes based on parent categories and sub-categories
- Converting data formats (e.g. - Unix timestamps in the dataset are converted to Excel's date format)
- A pivot table and pivot-chart line graph visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch dates.

The project concludes with a comprehensive Microsoft Word report addressing key questions:
- Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

 Three significant conclusions are drawn about crowdfunding campaigns based on the dataset, and the [Report](https://github.com/robert-z-lehr/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Unveiling_Crowdfunding_Trends/Report/) highlights the dataset's limitations:
 
 In essence, "Crowdfunding Trends Analysis" delves into the realm of crowdfunding data to provide valuable insights for creators, investors, and enthusiasts.
