# Crowdfunding Trends Analysis

## Tags:
- Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Functions

Given a dataset of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects from platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, this project uses Excel to manpulate and analyze this dataset to uncover hidden trends and key market insights.

The data manipulation and analysis includes:
- conditional formatting, (to visually distinguish campaign outcomes â€“ successful, failed, canceled, or live)
- using formulas to populate new columns
- Pivot tables and stacked-column pivot charts are constructed to assess campaign outcomes based on parent categories and sub-categories
- Converting data formats (e.g. - Unix timestamps in the dataset are converted to Excel's date format)
- A pivot table and pivot-chart line graph visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch dates.

The project concludes with a comprehensive Microsoft Word report addressing key questions:
- Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

 Three significant conclusions are drawn about crowdfunding campaigns based on the dataset, and the report highlights the dataset's limitations:
 - Insight 1
 - Insight 2
 - Insight 3
 
 In essence, "Crowdfunding Trends Analysis" delves into the realm of crowdfunding data to provide valuable insights for creators, investors, and enthusiasts.
